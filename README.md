# Software Documentation

## Introduction

This document serves as the software documentation for the implemented feature in assignments 4 and 5. It outlines the purpose of the document, the scope of the software, the software architecture, design, models, test cases, and the tools, languages, frameworks, and platforms used in the development process.

## Scope of the Software

The software aims to assist users in creating and following 
personalized workout plans. The application provides a user-friendly interface for logging 
in, creating workout routines, and accessing predefined workout plans for various fitness 
goals. Users can navigate between different workout plans, including Strength Training, 
Cardio, and Yoga, to meet their specific fitness objectives.

## Used Software Architecture

The software architecture follows a modular and layered approach, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and flexibility. It contains multiple layers such as presentation layer, business logic layer, and data access layer, facilitating separation of concerns and enabling easier maintenance and updates.

## Software Design and Model

The software design is represented using UML diagrams, including class diagrams, sequence diagrams These diagrams illustrate the structure, behavior, and interactions within the system.
